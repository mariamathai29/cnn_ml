This project was developed as part of the 2023 Global Engineering Challenge at the University of Toronto. The goal was to solve the issue of counterfeit meal tickets by developing a machine learning model to distinguish between real and fake tickets. 

We created an algorithm that generated 'fake' meal tickets by altering properties like angle, color, and size of real tickets. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was then trained using these generated images to detect counterfeit tickets effectively.
